# WikiDB API

This is a simple API for a wiki database. It is written in JavaScript and uses the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework, along with MongoDB for the database, and Mongoose for the object modeling.

Currently a work in progress.

## Installation

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
2. Install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/).
3. Clone this repository.
4. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
5. Run `npm start` to start the server.
6. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## lessons learned

I learned to work with Postman to test the API. I also picked up the Mongoose library to work with MongoDB. I also learned to use the Express framework to create a RESTful API.

Also used was Studio 3T to view the database and its contents, in tandem with MongoShell.
